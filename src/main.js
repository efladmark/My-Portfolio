          <h4 id="description">Living for the Fun of Exploration: I believe that life is for exploration, the exploration of self and world. We want to live for the fun of exploration, not the burden. Exploring who we are, where we come from, our connection to the earth and each other, and exploring what the future can be. When exploring this idea, I wanted to utilize a circular and directional form similar to a compass as the base of this image. Using it to guide the image production and assist in the narrative that our journeys are cyclical, but we are always moving towards the future (north). Constantly reminding ourselves and drawing from our past experiences that shape us and our ideas, and that we can use those to guide our exploration of the future. Creating this image reassured me of my place, and all that led me to where I am. Inspiring me to keep exploring and being open to where it will take me. </h4>
